EGDK es un motor de videojuegos 2D multiplataforma.</div><br/><br/>
</p>

This version of EGDK is under development and is being changed from Gtk+ to (cImgui/nuklear) to support sokol_gfx rendering.

The change is based on the fact that Gtk+ only has support for (Vulka) and the idea of EGDK is that it works everywhere according to the render of its own platform (Metal, DirectX and OpenGL).

What is EGDK?
===
A data-driven game engine where everything is a component. The idea is to make it a pretty good 2D game development engine, just like using UE4/UE5.

What I mean by UE4/UE5 is that the engine will have the best tools to build games as fast as possible depending on what you want.
